## About Ukagaka ##

[wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukagaka)

> Ukagaka (伺か), also known as Nanika (何か), Sakura (さくら), Nin'i-tan (任意たん) or Nise-Haruna (偽春菜), is a catch-all term for Japanese software which shares a single format and function: to provide a pair of mascot characters for the user’s computer desktop. These mascot characters can perform some useful functions such as checking e-mail or adjusting the clock of the computer, but are most popular as an aesthetic add-on, which “says” weird things.

Now, move it from computer desktop to website.

## Feature ##

* "says" things based on google sheets.
